# Classic Barbecue Sauce, by Aaron Franklin

Makes about 3 cups

## Ingredients

* 14 oz ketchup
* 10 tablespoons water
* 5 tablespoon cider vinegar
* 5 tablespoon white vinegar
* 4.5 tablespoons brown sugar
* 2.5 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tablespoon chile powder
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* 1.5 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1.5 teaspoons coarse black pepper

Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan and warm gently over medium heat, stirring occasionally. There is no need to bring the mixture to a boil, as the idea is just to warm it enough to melt and integrate the ingredients. Once you have done that, remove from the heat and let cool. Transfer to a jar, bottle, squeeze bottle, or however you want to store it. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
