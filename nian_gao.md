# Nian Gao

## Ingredients

* 1 lb (1 bag) rice flour (green, sweet glutinous)
* 3 cups liquid (start with a can of coconut milk and add enough cow milk or water to make 3 cups)
* 220 - 300 gm cup brown sugar (1 1/2 - 2 cups unpacked)
* 50 gm (1/4 cup) white sugar
* 3 eggs
* 100 gm vegetable oil (1/2 cup)
* 1 tbsp baking powder
* Red Bean (canned)

### Instructions

1. Grease 9x13 baking pan
1. Mix eggs, oil, and liquid
1. Add in sugars and flour and baking powder.
1. Pour into baking pan
1. Drop clumps of red bean on top and swirl. (They'll sink.)
1. Bake at 350F for 50 minutes.

### Modifications

* Coconut milk is pretty fatty, may want to reduce amount of oil if using all coconut milk. Consider adding water to the coconut milk to cut it.
* If not using red bean, up to 250gm of brown sugar. Canned red bean is usually packed in sugar.
* Unpacked brown sugar: 145 gm/cup; Packed brown sugar: 213 gm/cup. Mother's recipe calls for 2 unpacked cups (290gm).
