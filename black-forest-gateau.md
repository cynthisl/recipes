## Ingredients

### Cake
* 6 large eggs
* 150g sugar
* 95g all purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 50g cocoa powder, sifted

### For the filling and topping
* 1 lb cherries, pitted and chopped
* 1 cup kirsch

### Frosting
* 1 pint heavy cream
* 1/2 cup powdered sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla

## Directions

### Filling Prep
Soak the cherries in kirsch overnight. When ready, drain the cherries and reserve the liquid.

### Cake

1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly grease two 9in cake tins and line the base with greased non-stick baking parchment.

1. Break the eggs into a mixing bowl, add the sugar and whisk until the mixture is pale and thick enough to leave a trail when the whisk is lifted out of the bowl. Carefully fold in the sifted flour and cocoa powder. Turn the mixture into the prepared tins.

1. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the sponges are well risen and beginning to shrink away from the sides of the tin. Turn out onto a wire rack to cool and peel off the parchment.

### Filling

1. Boil reserved cherry-soaking kirsch and sugar to taste (not too sweet, just take off some of the edge). Let cool.

1. Poke holes with a toothpick all over the cakes. Use a brush to soak the syrup into the cake.

1. Whip the heavy cream and vanilla, slowly adding in the powdered sugar, until it reaches frosting consistency. 

1. Spread layer of cream onto the cake, top with cherry pieces. Put other cake on top.

1. Frost and decorated as desired.
