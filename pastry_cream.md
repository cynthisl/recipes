# Pastry Cream
From Tartine's recipe

## Ingredients

* 2 cups (500ml) Milk
* 1 1/2 tsp Vanilla Paste
* Pinch of Salt
* 4 tbsp (60 ml) cornstarch
* 115g (4 oz) Sugar
* 2 Eggs
* 4 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 1 tbsp cubes

## Directions
1. Prep a bowl for cooling the pastry cream with a sieve.
1. Combine milk, vanilla, and salt in a saucepan. 
1. Combine cornstarch and sugar; whisk in eggs until smooth
1. Bring milk mixure to light boil, medium high heat. 
1. Slowly add small amounts of hot milk into egg mixture, whisking constantly. If it's too fast, it'll curdle.
1. When egg mix is sufficiently tempered, mix the whole thing back into the saucepan and cook and whisk until the consistency of lightly whipped cream, about 2 minutes. It should come to a boil with slow bubbles.
1. Remove from heat and pour through sieve.
1. Let cool for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally so that a skin doesn't form on the top.
1. Whisk butter cubes into pastry cream one at a time until smooth.
1. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap directly onto the cream so a skin doesn't form.
