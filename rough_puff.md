# Rough Puff Pastry

## Ingredients

* 16 oz flour
* 16 oz unsalted butter (4 sticks), frozen
* 1 cup ice water (more like 14-15oz, use as needed)
* 3/4 tsp salt

## Directions

Note: Keep everything as cold as possible! Stick things back into fridge when not being worked.

### Dough

1. Grate butter into pieces.
1. Combine butter shavings, flour, and salt to form a shaggy, grainy dough. 
1. Slowly add water until dough comes together. Do not overwork.
1. Roll dough into ball and refrigerate for 20-30 mins.

### Turns

1. Flour work surface and roll out dough into 16x8" rectangle. A neater rectangle makes layering better.
1. Fold dough over in 3rds, similar to folding a letter to fit into an envelope.
1. Rotate dough 90 degrees and roll out into 16x8" rectangle again. Fold into 3rds again.
1. Wrap in plastic wrap and refridgerate for 30 mins.
1. Repeat turns for a total of 4 turns.
