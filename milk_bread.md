# Steps

## Tangzhong

Whisk together tangzhong ingredients over low heat for about two minutes, until very thick. Let cool to room temperature.

## Dough

Warm up milk, ~90F. Add yeast.

Mix dry ingredients: Flour, salt, sugar
Combine tangzhong, milk, and egg. 
Combine mixtures and knead with dough hook on low. Scrape or flour sides as needed.
When mixture comes together, raise to medium speed. Add in butter, 1 tbsp at a time, until incorporated. Keep mixing until smooth, 5-7 min.
Put into lightly greased bown and cover with damp towel or plastic wrap. 
Let rise in a warm spot for 2 hours, or overnight in the fridge 8-24 hours.
After first rise, punch down dough. Shape dough. Cover and proof for 1-2 hours.



Mix the ingredients of the tangzhong. Cook together constantly mixing until sticky and tacky. 30 sec- 2 mins. As soon as very think allow to cool to room temp Add yeast to 90-95F milk. Mix and sit for 10 mins. Assemble other ingredients. Wisk dry ingredients in mixer bowl. Put dough hook in. Add tengzhong, milk and yeast, and egg Start at low and scrape sides as needed. As soon as it comes together tun to medium speed. Keep on med-low, gradually adding in 42 g of butter, ⅓ at a time. Mix until incorporated. After incorporated mix for about 5-7 mins or until smooth. Dough may be a bit sticky - that is okay Dump onto work surface and roll into a tight boule. Place into a lightly greased bowl and cover with a towel. Rise at room tem 1-2 hrs until double. Punch down dough. Put on a floured surface and divide into 9 rolls, around 75 grams each. Lightly spray a 9X9 in pan Roll each ball into tight boules. Allow to prove 1-2 hrs at room temp, covered with a towel. Brush with egg wash Bake in 350 f oven for 28-30 mins Make garlic butter. Add chopped garlic to a cold pan with butter. Sweat garlic for 30s and then remove from the heat and let the residual heat cook the butter Remove buns from oven and immediately add the garlic butter. Add maldon salt to the top.

Prepare the dough the night before or at least 2-3 hours before baking. 
In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring milk to a boil to scald the milk. 
About 1-2 minutes. Watch the milk carefully so it doesn’t boil over. Set milk aside to cool.

To make the tangzhong, which is a flour starter that helps achieve a super fluffy dough, 
whisk together water and bread flour in a small saucepan over low heat. Continue to whisk until the
mixture looks like a thick paste. About 2 minutes. Remove the tangzhong from the heat and scrape into a 
small bowl to cool to room temperature.

In the bowl of your standmixer fitted with a dough hook, whisk together instant yeast, bread flour, sugar,
and salt. In another bowl combine the milk, tangzhong, and egg until evenly mixed. Carefully pour the wet
ingredients into the flour. Begin to knead on low and then increase to medium speed. Knead for 5 mins. 
Lightly dust with a bit of flour so the dough doesn’t stick to the sides of the bowl.

Add one tablespoon of butter at a time to the dough while the mixer is still going. Sprinkle a bit more 
flour and knead for about 5 minutes until smooth . 

Place dough in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. Let dough r
est in the fridge overnight (8-24 hours) or out in a warm spot for 2 hours.

After the first proof, scrap the dough out onto a clean kitchen surface. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. 
Cover the dough with a damp kitchen towel while forming. Roll out 1 piece of dough and roll it out into a roughly 
3”x7” rectangle or blog. Place 1 hot dog in the center of the dough. Roll up the hot dog in the dough and pinch 
the seams closed. Cut the hotdog into 6 equal pieces. Arrange the 6 pieces in the shape of a flower - 1 piece in the 
center with 5 petals. Place the hot dog flower on a parchment lined baking tray. Repeat with remaining buns. Cover hot 
dog flower buns with a damp kitchen towel and allow to proof one last time for 40-60 minutes.

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Brush the buns with egg wash and top with chopped scallions and sesame seeds. 
Bake the buns for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.

While the buns are baking, make your syrup glaze. Boil water and sugar for 1-2 minutes. Brush the sugar glaze 
on the baked buns as soon as they come out of the oven.

Allow the buns to cool for a few minutes and then enjoy!
